        <h2>The Evolution of Basketball Throughout The Years</h2>
        <h3>How Basketball Went from a Gym Game to a Major Competitive Sport</h3>
        <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-1e16b974-7fff-4195-9191-7e73837f32e6">On this basketball informational page, it will be discussing all about the sport of basketball and how it became one of the most popular sports in the world. More specifically, it will discuss the history behind the game of basketball and how the real purpose for inventing basketball wasn&rsquo;t for competitive purposes but rather for recreational play. Additionally, it will talk about the evolution of the sport and how much the game has changed over the years (things such as the ball they used and the hoop they used vs what is used now). This website will also talk about some of the top basketball leagues from around the globe such as the NBA, EuroLeague and the CBA. It will be more specific to the NBA (the top league in the United States and known by many as the top league in the world) as I will discuss some of the top players in that league playing today. It also will mention who the top statistical leaders in the NBA are over the past 75 years.&nbsp;</strong></p>

        This can be hypertext type (as above) OR a bit of code implemented from codepen.io (which uses the same login as Github.com). <br>
        Small challenge here that may take some tinkering to get it to work but the results are&nbsp;
